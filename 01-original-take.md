I want and app that allows me to enter my daily meals and hidration, and will keep track of my daily nutrient (including purines) and caloric intake, as well as keep track of its history for control.

Main screen (Meal Diary) should show a calendar day picker that defaults to current day. I should be able to select what meal I'm entering (breakfast, lunch, dinner or snack). I can enter the ingredient list or meal name, and may attach either 1 or more meal pics, or nutritional labels of consumed ingredients. The app should analyze the entered information to estimate the nutritional intake and store it in a DB and show it as a meal name + estimated ingredient list. Main screen should show per ingredient, per meal  and daily total purine and caloric intake, and daily hidration.

I should be able to edit entries if a correction is needed, even attaching pics if available, and this should trigger a recalculation of ONLY the corresponding edited values.

To keep value coherence, if a given ingredient exists from a previous meal, the app should calculate for the new quantities using the existing nutrient and caloric information instead of fetching new ones.

In a different view (Chart Gallery), historic information can be seen, picking from 2 default views (week or month to date) or from a desired range. Here all nutritional (including purines) and caloric values can be seen, and filtered out if desired. This must be dynamic and visual. Recommended max nutritional values for the user information should be visible. User should be able to select grouping (daily, weekly, monthly) of the data being shown. All nutrient information can be filtered out if needed.

In a different view (What to eat?), I should be able to select a range (either current day or last 6 days) and a given meal, with the app recommending me 3 meal options that wouldn't break the max values or recommendations for the given time frame. The meal options should be 1 in accordance to his usual meals, and the other 2 as distinct as possible. This recommendations will only be fetched when the user has selected all options and clicked on a "Let's Cook!" button.

In a settings view, user should be able to enter sex, age, dietary needs (for example, medical conditions), min and max purine and caloric values (where above min would be recognized as "Warning" and above max would be "Danger" thresholds), current weight, and add any other information needed to properly calculate his nutritional needs and meal recommendations. Name can also be entered for personalization purposes. Here you can also acccess a sort of dictionary of recurrent items where they can be created so the user could add frequently used meals (for example, create a "pb&j sandwich", and include the typical ingredient list and quantities so the Meal Diary can simply refer to it for the ingredient information, or create a named bottle, for example "bucio", enter the capacity, and the Meal Diary refers to it for the consumed hidration). Finally, there should be a color theme picker that allows to select some presets, bright, dark and high contrast, as well as a color picker that would be the main color and the rest of the needed colors would be appropiate colors for the main chosen.

All entered information must be persistent for me, so wherever i log in to my meal app i can see my information. I dont want it to be 100% serious, should be colorful and whimsical. As you can see from my section titles and button recommendations, i prefer an informal style.
